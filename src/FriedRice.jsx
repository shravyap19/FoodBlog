        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Prepare Ingredients:</strong> Cook the rice according to
          package instructions and let it cool. Ensure that the rice is not warm
          or hot, as this can result in mushy fried rice. Chop all vegetables
          and protein into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Scramble Eggs:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in
          a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Pour the beaten eggs
          into the skillet and scramble until fully cooked. Remove the scrambled
          eggs from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Stir-Fry Vegetables:</strong> In the same skillet, add the
          remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add minced garlic and sliced
          green onions, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add diced vegetables to the skillet and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until
          they are tender-crisp.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Add Rice:</strong> Add the cooked rice to the skillet and
          break up any clumps using a spatula. Stir-fry the rice with the
          vegetables for 2-3 minutes until heated through.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Season:</strong> Pour soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using)
          over the rice and vegetables. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
          Mix well to evenly distribute the sauces and seasoning.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Add Protein:</strong> If using cooked protein such as chicken,
          shrimp, or tofu, add it to the skillet with the fried rice and toss to
          combine.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Final Touch:</strong> Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet
          and toss everything together until well combined and heated through.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the fried rice to serving plates or
          bowls. Garnish with additional sliced green onions, if desired. Enjoy
          your delicious homemade fried rice!
