      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol className="about_me_desc list-decimal ml-5">
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Soak the Urad Dal:</strong> Rinse the urad dal under running
          water until the water runs clear. Soak the urad dal in enough water
          for 4-6 hours or overnight. This will soften the dal, making it easier
          to grind.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Grind the Dal:</strong> After soaking, drain the water from
          the dal. In a blender or a wet grinder, grind the urad dal into a
          smooth and fluffy batter. Add a little water if needed, but be careful
          not to add too much water; the batter should be thick. Transfer the
          batter to a mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Prepare the Vada Mix:</strong> To the urad dal batter, add
          finely chopped green chilies, grated ginger, chopped onions (if
          using), chopped coriander leaves, whole black peppercorns, cumin
          seeds, asafoetida, and salt to taste. Mix all the ingredients well to
          combine.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Shape the Vadas:</strong> Heat oil in a deep frying pan or
          kadhai over medium heat. Wet your hands with water to prevent
          sticking, take a small portion of the vada mix, and shape it into a
          small round ball. Flatten the ball slightly between your palms to form
          a disc shape. You can also make a hole in the center to give it the
          traditional vada shape.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Fry the Vadas:</strong> Once the oil is hot, carefully slide
          the shaped vadas into the hot oil, one by one. Fry the vadas in
          batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the vadas on medium
          heat, flipping occasionally, until they turn golden brown and crispy
          on all sides. Once done, remove the fried vadas using a slotted spoon
          and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the hot and crispy vadas with coconut
          chutney, sambar, or any dipping sauce of your choice. Enjoy your
          delicious homemade vadas as a snack or part of a South Indian meal!
