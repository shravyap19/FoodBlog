          <strong>Prepare Fruit Mixture:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine
          fruit juice or puree with honey, maple syrup, or sugar. Stir until the
          sweetener is fully dissolved.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Add Fresh Fruit (Optional):</strong> If desired, add chopped
          fresh fruit to the fruit mixture. This step adds texture and
          additional flavor to the popsicles.

        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Fill Popsicle Molds:</strong> Pour the fruit mixture into
          popsicle molds, leaving a little space at the top for expansion.
          Insert popsicle sticks into the center of each mold.

        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Freeze:</strong> Place the popsicle molds in the freezer and
          let them freeze for at least 4-6 hours, or until completely solid.

        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Unmold:</strong> Once the popsicles are fully frozen, remove
          them from the freezer. To unmold the popsicles, run warm water over
          the outside of the molds for a few seconds to loosen them. Gently pull
          on the popsicle sticks to release the popsicles from the molds.
        </li>
        <li className="procedure-list">
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the homemade popsicles immediately or
          store them in the freezer in an airtight container or plastic bag for
